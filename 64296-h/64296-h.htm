      <p class="pfirst"><span>The construction of model aeroplanes is essentially simple and for those wishing to experiment it is an ideal method of gaining practical knowledge of the new science of aeronautics.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Aside from the utilitarian standpoint, there is another aspect hardly second or less important. A well balanced little machine which will leave the hand and soar away under its own power is a source of fascination and delight not only to its maker, but to the spectators of the flight as well.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>This little volume has been planned to present the material it contains in such a manner that it will aid the judgment of the experimenter and assist him in developing his own ideas. To make it of immediate value to the novice a number of detailed plans for building various machines have been included. For the greater part these machines have been designed rather to fly greater distances than to appear like some man carrying prototype.</span></p>

      <p class="pfirst"><span>To enter deeply into a discussion of the theory of the aeroplane would not only tire the reader but would waste valuable space in endeavoring to explain that which has been more adequately dealt with in more notable works.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>In order to gain a clear understanding of the following chapters, however, it will be necessary to first grasp the elementary principles underlying the flight of an aeroplane. In setting these forth, I shall try, as far as possible, not to hamper or confuse with unnecessary terms or technicalities, except where such might be of worth in rendering a better conception of that to which they apply.</span></p>

          <span class="italics">FIG. 1. Diagram showing a kite held in the air by the action of a wind. The dotted lines and arrow heads represent the direction and force of the wind.</span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="pnext"><span>An ordinary kite is one of the best examples of the action of an aeroplane. It is scarcely necessary to define the kite; it is a rigid frame of wooden sticks, on which is stretched a surface of cloth or paper. A string attached to the kite by means of a "bridle" serves to hold the apparatus to the ground.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>In Fig. 1 is represented a kite against which the wind is blowing as indicated by the dotted lines. The string is so arranged that the kite is inclined at an angle to the wind and thus is sustained in the air by the force of the wind, viz., the molecules of air in striking against the slanting surface exert a pressure upon it which both calculation and experiment show to be perpendicular to the surface and tending to lift it. The kite also exerts a strong pull on the string which holds it in position.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>But on days when there is no breeze or when the wind suddenly dies out; what is to be done then?</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Wind is not an absolute thing. It is a</span> <em class="italics">relative</em> <span>movement of the surrounding air in</span> <em class="italics">comparison</em> <span>to a body. The effect is the same, and the relative movement takes place whether the air is still and the body in motion, or the air is in motion and the body motionless.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>It is therefore an easy matter to "create a breeze" and a kite can be kept in the air providing the person flying the kite and holding the string commences to run.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Although no wind is blowing, the pressure of the air through which the kite is moving will cause it to remain in the air. In other words, the kite would be sustained in the air by virtue of</span> <em class="italics">its own relative motion to the wind</em><span>. In order that the kite may fly, it makes no difference whether the wind moves against the kite or the kite moves against the wind.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>An aeroplane, in fact, is nothing but a kite which creates its own breeze. If an aeroplane were attached to a strong wire serving as the string in the case of the kite, it would fly in the same manner as the kite, providing of course that the wind were sufficiently powerful. If the wind were not blowing at all, or not blowing hard enough, the other end of the wire could be attached to an automobile and by driving the automobile fast enough the required</span> <em class="italics">relative motion</em> <span>of the air would be produced and the aeroplane would fly.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>There could be no direct benefit derived, however, from an aeroplane which must remain attached to a machine running over the earth and travel in its wake. Some other means of producing the required relative motion is necessary so that the aeroplane may be free to fly in any direction and either with or against the wind. This is accomplished by a</span> <em class="italics">propeller</em> <span>driven by a motor revolving at high speed in the aeroplane itself.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The action of an aerial propeller is similar to that of its marine prototype employed for driving ships through the water. Each depends for its action upon the imparting of a sternward motion to a column of fluid, in the one case air and in the other water. A propeller screws itself forward into the surrounding media in identically the same manner that an ordinary screw forces itself into a block of wood. An aeroplane therefore essentially consists of the wings or supporting surfaces, also sometimes called planes, driven through the air in an</span> <em class="italics">oblique</em> <span>manner by the propeller and motor.</span></p>

The devices used to accomplish this are two rudders called respectively the "elevator" and the "steering rudder." The "elevator" takes the form of a small surface carried either in front or behind the main supporting surfaces and enables the machine to take an upward, a horizontal or downward course accordingly as it is adjusted. It acts as a rudder to steer the aeroplane up or down or to hold it to its course in exactly the same manner that a ship's rudder steers it to the right or left. When it is desired to direct the aeroplane upwards, the front edge of the elevator is raised so as to set it at a greater angle with the horizontal. If the aeroplane's course is required to be downward, the front edge of the elevator is lowered.</span>

      <p class="pnext"><span>Aeroplanes are usually of two general types,</span> <em class="italics">monoplanes</em> <span>and</span> <em class="italics">biplanes</em><span>. A monoplane, as its name implies, is a machine having a single pair of wings or supporting surfaces. The Bleriot, Antoinette and Santos Dumont machines are the most prominent representatives of this type of aeroplane.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The "elevator" on a monoplane is usually in the rear of the main supporting surfaces. When in this position it also acts as a tail to furnish longitudinal stability to the machine in the same way that a feather on an arrow steadies its flight.</span></p>

The old practice of placing the elevator in the front of a biplane is gradually being abandoned and it is safe to say that by the time this book has been printed all these machines will be of the "headless" variety with the elevator in the rear.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The vertical fins shown between the planes of the elevator in the old type of biplane, counterbalance the effect of gusts of wind striking the vertical rudder from the sides and also act as a pivot for turning to the right and left. Together with the steering rudder, they constitute a sort of keel which keeps the machine straight to its course.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>In order for an aeroplane to fly in the accepted sense of the word, it must possess supporting surfaces, an elevator or tail and a propeller driven by a motor. These are essentially the sustaining, propelling and steering members of the machine.</span></p>

      <h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><span>CHAPTER II. GENERAL REMARKS REGARDING MODEL AEROPLANE CONSTRUCTION. THE QUESTION OF RESISTANCE. WEIGHT. STABILITY.</span></h2>
      <p class="pfirst"><strong class="bold">The first requirement</strong> <span>of a model aeroplane is that it shall fly. The first essential for a machine to fly well is that it must be simple. Simplicity usually insures success and is synonymous with efficiency. A complicated scale model having as its prototype one of the most successful man-carrying machines usually will not fly. If it does fly,</span> <em class="italics">it does not do so well</em><span>. Miniature steam engines, motors, etc., can be constructed to exact scale and will justify their existence by actually working and performing duty, but in most cases a model aeroplane made to scale will not fly well until it begins to approach full size.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The next indispensable feature might be called</span> <em class="italics">lightness</em><span>, but at the same time it must be borne in mind that strength is also "second to none" and it would be fatal to sacrifice the one for the other. The hard knocks and battering which a model usually receives at the hands of a novice will soon wreck any flimsy construction.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">To design model aeroplanes will at first seem like</strong> <span>"robbing Peter to pay Paul," that is, no one part can be developed to an extreme without seriously affecting the efficiency of the other parts. The successful machine is a sort of "happy medium" arrived at solely through experiment. A thorough understanding, however, of the part played by each individual member of a model and its characteristics will make it possible to avoid much unnecessary work in that connection. It is therefore well to carefully read the following chapters before commencing to carry out any original ideas or to make any radical departure from the designs offered in this book.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>From these statements it must not be inferred that the successful model aeroplane builder is necessarily an individual possessed of consummate skill in the handling of tools or a person of unusual judgment. A few simple tools and trifling mechanical ability will enable any one to build the simple little machines herein described. The greatest asset required in the work is patience, patience spelled with a capital "P." Not only patience in building the machines, but patience in adjusting them and patience in flying them. Making haste with a model aeroplane is poor policy. It never pays to use slipshod methods. Take the time to make sure every part is the best that you can make it. Care with the little details will insure success.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Model aeroplanes are exasperating to the extreme. A new model will swerve to the right and left or dive with unerring precision to the ground or nearest object. They seem to defy all attempts to make them behave and in the first few flights usually perform a "new one" every time. This is the point where success comes to the model aeroplanist who possesses patience and perseverance. One must learn to adjust and fly a model aeroplane by practice just as he must also learn to swim or ride a bicycle by repeated trials. A little persuasion will soon make a model soar in a surprising manner.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The question of resistance</strong> <span>is the first consideration of the model aeroplane designer. An aeroplane should pass through the air in such a manner that it leaves that medium in as motionless a state as possible. All motion of the surrounding air represents so much power wasted. It is obvious that a boat with a square prow will offer more resistance than a ship having a sharp bow. The latter causes considerably less disturbance of the fluid in which it moves than the former.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">Automatic stability</strong> <span>without doubt has attracted more attention from engineers and aviators than any other one problem connected with aviation. Since it is not possible for a model aeroplane to carry a pilot it is much more important that it should be naturally stable than any of its man-carrying prototypes. Automatic stability in a model of only two or three feet spread at the most, is quite a different proposition from that offered by a full-size machine.</span></p>

      <h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><span>CHAPTER III. PLANES AND RUDDERS. ELEVATORS AND TAILS.</span></h2>
      <p class="pfirst"><span>In Chapter I it was explained that an aeroplane is fundamentally composed of a supporting surface, divided into one or two parts, usually the planes or wings, which cut the air in an oblique manner, driven by a propeller and motor. Before going further it is perhaps best to understand more exactly how the planes operate and support the machine in the air than it was possible to explain in the first chapter without confusion. A theoretical aeroplane consists of a flat surface or plane. When the propeller is set into motion the plane is driven through the air in an oblique manner and compels the gaseous molecules to glide under its surface. Since the plane is at an angle, the front edge being higher than the back, the air must necessarily leave at the rear in a downward direction. The air molecules in traveling under the surface exercise a resistance upon it which is really a pressure against the plane. When this pressure is resolved into its components, it is found to be made up of two forces, one horizontal, tending to retard the forward motion, and called the</span> <em class="italics">drift</em><span>; the other, vertical and tending to</span> <em class="italics">lift</em> <span>the plane.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The centre of these forces is not as might be supposed at the centre of the plane, but at a point between the centre and the front edge called the "centre of pressure." The centre of pressure approaches the front edge as the angle of the plane with the horizontal becomes less.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>In order to render a better idea of how it is possible for an aeroplane to gain support in the air consider a skater moving swiftly over very thin ice which would not bear his weight, but since he is moving so rapidly that any one portion of the ice does not have time to bend to the breaking point, he is supported. In somewhat the same manner, the planes pass so rapidly on to new and undisturbed bodies of air, and stay over one body for so brief an instant that there is no time to completely overcome the inertia of the air and force it downwards.</span></p>

          <span class="italics">FIG. 12. The action of the air upon a curved and a flat plane. We have seen that by the effects of the resistance of the air, an aeroplane may be sustained in the atmosphere. We must now see in what manner we can use these effects to the greatest advantage.</span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="pnext"><span>First of all, we have been continually speaking of a "plane" as the supporting surface, which from the definition of the word would lead one to believe that they were flat. If the wings of a bird are examined, it will soon be noticed that they are concave underneath. Since the first attempts at aviation, therefore, machines have been built with planes or wings concave on the underside. The reason for this is very apparent from Fig. 12. The first illustration shows the action of a flat surface moving through the air. The air streams, as represented by the lines do not follow the surface of the plane, but leave a considerable region of dead air. This is the reason that a flat plane is very inefficient and not capable of giving so great a lift as the curved plane in the next figure where the lines follow the outline of the plane. The less disturbance a plane causes in the surrounding air, the closer it is said to approach to "stream line form." A correctly curved plane is considerably more effectual than a flat one, giving at the same time greater "lift" and less "drift."</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">Built-up Planes</strong><span>, that is, planes having a double curve approaching true stream line form, come nearer being the ideal plane than any other from some standpoints, but do not possess any advantages when used on models of less than four feet spread.</span></p>

          <span class="italics">FIG. 13. Section of a built-up plane showing how a rib is made. When made small, they offer greater "drift" or head resistance than a single curved surface plane and cannot because of the delicate structure necessary to make them light, withstand hard knocks. They have the further disadvantage of being from a constructional standpoint very hard to make smooth and rigid.</span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="pnext"><span>There are innumerable substances which would at first seem to recommend themselves as material for planes, but we may immediately thrust the greater portion aside. By all means</span> <em class="italics">avoid tracing cloth or linen</em><span>, not only because its heavy weight forever precludes it from this use, but because it wrinkles and cockles so as to be absolutely useless when slightly damp or wet.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">Tissue paper</strong> <span>wrinkles easily and is not strong enough.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">Jap silk</strong> <span>is an excellent material for fabric covered planes, being at once light and strong. However, by far the most satisfactory plane of this kind is formed by silk bolting cloth which has been coated with collodion. The collodion is brushed on with a fine camel's hair brush after the fabric is in place and it is thereby rendered both waterproof and air-tight.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Fabrics should always be stretched over the planes from end to end and not front to back or vice versa. Make the lap joints or pockets around the end spars as long as possible so that they will not draw "dead air" and impede the forward motion of the machine.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">Bamboo Paper</strong> <span>is one of the best materials for covering the planes of a model aeroplane and is to be highly recommended. It is made in Japan from bamboo fibre and is very strong. It is usually stretched tightly over the framework and then given two coats of collodion or, what is much better, bamboo varnish.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The framework</strong> <span>of the planes may be made of rattan, split bamboo, spruce, or steel piano wire. Piano wire is excellent for small machines since it is springy and light and able to withstand shocks. It is easily bent to any shape and offers considerably less head resistance than rattan because of its small diameter. Rattan can be bent into almost any shape by wetting.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Nothing is better for the cross pieces, ribs, etc., of the planes or framework than split bamboo. Bulk for bulk it is heavier but infinitely stronger than other woods. It is easily worked and can be bent into all kinds of shapes. Bamboo must always be bent while hot. The best source of heat is a spirit lamp or a bunsen burner. Always bend</span> <em class="italics">toward</em> <span>the hottest side. When bent apply a cold wet rag to cool quickly. If bent more than necessary, it may be straightened by applying heat again and allowing it to straighten itself.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>In order to make long bends, such as the ends of planes, alighting skids, etc., first wind a strip of wet rag around, the bamboo and allow it to remain on for ten or fifteen minutes. Then remove the rag, heat the bamboo in a flame and bend slowly.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">Planes</strong> <span>of any considerable size require ribs to support and hold the fabric in shape. Split bamboo is one of the best materials for this purpose. Two very good methods of joining the ribs to the long members of the planes are illustrated in Fig. 14. In the first, a strip of thin sheet aluminum is bent around the rib and spar and fastened by lashing with silk thread. Care must be taken to file off all sharp edges on the aluminum which might otherwise cut the thread. The second method is the neatest and probably the best, since the rib cannot so easily twist or slip out of place.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">Wood Planes.</strong> <span>In spite of the many advantages of fabric planes they cannot approach wooden planes for efficiency on a small machine. Wood is strong, light and does not change its adjustment.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Whitewood and spruce are the best materials for the purpose. Do not endeavor to saw out the wood. Use a carpenter's plane as much as possible in the work. A saw tears the fibres of the wood and will make the finished plane full of tiny splits.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The wood, however, may be sawed down to a thickness of 5/32 of an inch and then planed down from that. The finished plane should be about 1/16 of an inch thick.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>When planing down the wood do not butt one end against a bench stop, because as the wood becomes thin, the pressure exerted by the plane against the wood will cause it to rise in the middle and thereby become thinner at that part. Instead, use a clamp to fasten the wood at one end to the bench and</span> <em class="italics">plane away</em> <span>from the clamp—Plane down to a smooth surface and</span> <em class="italics">avoid</em> <span>the use of sand-paper.</span></p>

A piece of wood of the same length as the completed plane and having a cross section like that at A is glued to the forward under edge of a flat plane B. After the glue has hardened, the plane is worked down to the shape shown at D which is very close to the stream line form. The plane is then varnished to prevent it from absorbing moisture and losing its shape. The ends may be covered with thin Jap silk, carefully glued on to prevent splitting. The Wright brothers cover the blades of the propellers on their aeroplanes with silk for the same purpose.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Air does not flow smoothly when changing from an interrupted flow to an uninterrupted flow around a square corner and so by rounding the ends of the planes, the disturbance at that point is somewhat eliminated.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>The angles at which the planes are set may vary from 1 in 6 to 1 in 20. One in ten might be called the "happy medium." If the planes are given too great an angle, the drift becomes so great that the propeller thrust is severely taxed. The smaller the angle, the less will be the drift and consequently the greater the speed. However, if the surface is curved the angle must not be made too small or not much lift will result.</span></p>

      <p class="pfirst"><span>By the term "fusellage" or frames, that part of the aeroplane which serves as the "backbone" and to which all the other members are attached is implied.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The fusellage above all must be strong. The second requisite is lightness. The simplest frame for a model aeroplane is a long straight stick. The cross section of the stick may vary and be either round or square. A careful workman, however, can build them of "I" section like a steel girder. Increased lightness and strength is the result.</span></p>

      </div>
      <p class="pnext"><span>A single skein of elastic when wound up tends very strongly to twist the framework of the machine out of true. Since the tail and elevator are usually attached to the ends, the adjustment is thrown out to a marked degree and the flight of the machine is liable to be erratic.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>We have tried building the fusellage of a network of girders such as the Bleriot and Voisin aeroplanes employ. Nothing could have been prettier than these carefully designed and constructed frames with their little struts and guy wires, but we soon found that for plain ordinary everyday efficiency, the simple stick is the best, provided, of course, that it is of the proper size to resist the twist of the rubber.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>In some cases it is desirable to retain the framework because of the realistic appearance of the model to the larger machines which it gives. The only practical method then is to employ a plain stick backbone to withstand the torque of the rubber and build a false framework around it. The framework need only be strong enough to support the fabric and resist the shocks of landing. This method of construction is best suited to models of the Bleriot and Antoinette types.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The only type of frame consisting of a single member which will resist the torque of powerful rubber bands successfully is a tube. The rubber skein is placed inside the tube which may be of wood, paper or aluminum.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>Paper tubes are excellent for small machines, being exceedingly light and very strong. They are formed by wrapping tough, unglazed paper around a rod of the required inside diameter. The paper is well smeared with glue and wrapped tightly. The rod is afterwards removed. Be sure that the glue is thoroughly dry before attempting to use the tube.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>In larger machines it is preferable to employ some other means of avoiding the nuisance of a single skein rather than to use a tubular frame. There are several ways of accomplishing this, the best one undoubtedly being to balance the torque of one elastic by an equal torque tending to twist in the opposite direction.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>In Fig. 23, a second skein of elastic is geared to the first with equal sized gear wheels. The second skein is placed immediately underneath the first and is equal in length and strength. Placing one skein under the other and not side by side as might be the first tendency allows the propeller to be arranged centrally. The lower part of the same figure illustrates a second method. In this, the propeller is attached to a long shaft, the other end of which is fitted with a gear wheel. Two elastic skeins of equal length and strength are attached to a second gear which meshes with the first. The only disadvantage of this form of motor is the long propeller shaft required. The objection, however, is sometimes outweighed by the fact that it is possible to employ a small gear wheel on the shaft meshing with a large one between the bands so that the action of the elastic is multiplied and a greater number of propeller revolutions secured where the length of the bands is limited and could not be increased in order to bring about the same result.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">Skids.</strong> <span>It requires only very little experience with model aeroplanes to prove the need of efficient skids on the machine. After the rubber band motor has run down, the propeller offers considerable resistance to the forward travel of the machine so that it does not glide properly and causes it to land on its "nose," often damaging the propeller or front planes. At the least, the framework of the machine is strained by such a shock.</span></p>

      <h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><span>CHAPTER V. MOTIVE POWER.</span></h2>
      <p class="pfirst"><span>By far the simplest and most efficient form of power which could be installed in a model aeroplane to drive the propeller is a twisted skein of rubber. Nothing is lighter, or more easily handled and repaired.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The word</span> <em class="italics">elastic</em><span>, in physics, is the name given to the tendency which a body exerts, when distorted, to return to its original shape. Rubber possesses more elasticity than any other material known, it being possible to stretch a piece of rubber cord to eight or nine times its original length without fracture. Rubber also possesses the added requisite of lightness and will store up more energy than any form of steel spring.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Simplest Form of Motor</strong> <span>is a single skein of elastic stretched between two hooks, one fixed and the other to which the propeller is attached, free to rotate. In some cases it is a decided advantage to divide the motor into one or more parts. One phase of this question has already been considered. The others will be discussed in the following chapter.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The type of Elastic</strong> <span>which gives at once the longest life and the greatest power is the</span> <em class="italics">square</em> <span>rubber, preferably about 3/32 x 3/32 inches, and not the flat strip. When examined under the microscope the edges of the square rubber show to be cleaner and sharper and not so ragged as those of the flat strips. To be of any value for use in a model aeroplane, the rubber should be absolutely pure and fresh.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>There are certain precautions which if observed will add greatly to the power and efficiency of a rubber band motor.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Always remove the elastic from the machine when the flights are over for the time being. Rubber spoils very quickly when kept under tension. It also deteriorates if warm, so keep in a cool place. Strong sunlight causes rubber to harden and lose its elasticity, due to the presence of the sulphur used in vulcanizing. If talcum powder or finely powdered soapstone is rubbed on the bands from time to time it will prevent them from sticking together. The strands will then run and slip more easily upon each other, making it possible to store up a greater number of propeller revolutions.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>In spite of the use of talcum powder, however, when a skein of rubber is twisted very tightly, the strands stick together, causing it to soon break up.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>This nuisance may be somewhat alleviated if the strands are lubricated with</span> <em class="italics">pure redistilled</em> <span>glycerine free from grease, etc. Such a precaution will not always greatly lengthen the life of the rubber, but will increase the number of turns which it is possible to give the skein (and this is a very important advantage in model contests). Due to its sticky nature, however, the glycerine will cause the rubber to gather dust and particles of dirt which, if allowed to grind into the rubber, would soon weaken it. The skein should therefore be washed from time to time in warm soda and water and fresh glycerine applied. By all means, avoid all oils or substances of a greasy nature, such as lubricants. They quickly soften and rot the rubber.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Amount of Elastic</strong> <span>required for a model will vary considerably for propellers of the same pitch and diameter. There is always a tendency to use too much rather than too little and this fault should be carefully guarded against. In nine cases out of ten it is the cause of the unsatisfactory behavior of a model.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The motor should always be "stranded," that is, made up of a skein of bands. It is then possible to secure a larger number of turns than if a single strip were used.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Always start a new machine with a small number of strands and gradually add to the number until the proper amount of power is obtained. The distance between the propeller and the fixed hook should always be as great as possible so as to secure the maximum number of turns.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">Doubling the Number of Elastic Strands</strong> <span>increases the power of the motor but cuts down the number of turns which it is possible to give the propeller. That is to say, a certain skein composed of six strands of rubber will take perhaps two hundred and twenty-five turns while a twelve strand skein of he same sized rubber strands strands is only capable of less than half or about one hundred turns before it is wound tight.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Doubling the number of strands and at the same time keeping them the same length increases the torque more than three times but diminishes the number of turns from one-half to one-third.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">Doubling the length</strong> <span>of the strands does not materially reduce the torque for the first hundred turns. After two hundred turns have been reached, the torque is only about one-half as great as it would be in case the length were not doubled.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Doubling the length of the strands doubles the number of turns it is possible to give the skein. It is easy to see from this why it is always advisable to make the</span> <em class="italics">motor as long as possible</em> <span>and to compose it of the fewest number of strands if long flights are desirable.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>By using several separate skeins geared together so as to apply their energy to one screw, it is possible to obtain a greatly increased number of turns. The weight of the gearing is very small and hardly a factor, considering the advantages derived therefrom. Since the skeins revolve in opposite directions the frame of the machine is relieved of the harmful twisting effect so often present in a single skein.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The gears should be of steel accurately cut and of no larger diameter than is necessary to separate the rubber skeins the requisite distances so that they will not rub.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Holes may be bored in the gears to lighten them. The gears are easily and conveniently cut out of steel pinion wire.</span></p>

      <p class="pfirst"><span>We might compare a propeller to an ordinary screw or bolt by likening the thread of the screw to the two blades of the propeller. If the screw penetrates wood or metal nut it will advance a certain distance known as the</span> <em class="italics">pitch</em> <span>which is always the same, namely, the distance separating two consecutive turns of the threads. The revolving blades of the propeller cut their way through the air in identically the same manner. But since air is a very thin medium as compared to wood or iron the propeller slips a little just like a screw going into an unsteady nut and does not advance the distance it theoretically should considering the angle of the blades. The distance lost in each revolution is called the</span> <em class="italics">slip</em><span>. Thus a screw having a ten-foot pitch in actual operation perhaps only advances the aeroplane eight feet.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>If a propeller blade had a uniform angle throughout its entire length the portions of the blade near the centre would not have as great a pitch as the extreme tips because the diameter of the circle they travel in one revolution is not as great as that at the tips.

      <p class="pnext"><span>Fig 26 shows a diagram illustrating the theoretical pitch of a screw, the angle of the blade varying inversely as its radial distance from the centre of the screw.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>When a propeller revolves it sets in motion a cylinder of air. If the angle of the blades is uniform throughout their length the air in the centre of the cylinder will move much more slowly than that near the outside as shown by the arrow heads in A of Fig. 27. If the blades are given an increasing pitch, the air in all parts of the cylinder will move away from the propeller at the same speed.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>From a diagram like this it is very easy to calculate the angle of a blade at any point to secure a certain pitch. Suppose that the problem in hand is to design a propeller eight inches in diameter and a pitch of twelve inches. On a sheet of paper draw a vertical line AM twelve inches long to represent the pitch. Draw a long horizontal line AN of indefinite length from the lower end of AM and at right angles to it. The diameter of the propeller being eight inches, the tips of the blades must travel in one revolution 8 x 3.1416 (the circumference of an eight inch circle in inches), a distance of 33.1 inches. Lay off on AN the distance AB which is 33.1 inches, draw the line MB. The angle MB forms with AN is the proper angle for the blades at the tips. To find the angle one inch from the tips lay off the distance AC, which is. 8 - 2 x 3.1416 or 24.8 inches. MC gives the right angle. The angle two inches from the tip would be shown by MD where AD is 8 - 4 x 3.1416 or 18.8 inches. Any other points can be located in the same manner.</span></p>

The propeller is laid out on a square or rectangular strip of wood (according to the pitch), cut to the required length. A pocket knife or a wood rasp is used to rough the wood down to the shape shown at B. It is then finished down to the form shown at C. After rubbing with sand-paper a coat of varnish is applied and allowed to dry. The varnish is then rubbed down to a smooth surface.</span></p>

After steaming place one end of the strip in a vise and holding the other in the fingers twist it into the right shape. Fasten it in position and allow it to remain so until dry. Then give it a coat of varnish to prevent the absorption of moisture and consequent warping. The method of fastening the shaft, which in this case is a piece of piano wire or a bicycle spoke is illustrated in Fig. 35. Two small pieces of wood shaped like a half cylinder and having a groove cut on the curved surface are glued on either side at the centre. The shaft is then bent around and twisted.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Single Screw Machine.</strong> <span>A propeller placed in the rear of a machine is usually more efficient than a "tractor" screw placed in front. A machine drags along considerable air with it (due to skin friction of the planes, etc.), and so a screw placed in the rear revolves in air which is really traveling with the machine itself and so the effect is somewhat as though it were traveling with the wind. A further advantage of placing the propeller in the rear of the machine lies in the fact that there is less likelihood of damage in landing.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>An aeroplane having a single screw always betrays a marked tendency to turn completely over in a direction opposite to that in which the screw is rotating. Action and reaction are always equal and opposite in their effects and so the motor has a tendency to rotate the machine against the resistance of the screw as well as to rotate the screw against the resistance of the machine.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>One way in overcoming this difficulty is to set the two halves of the plane at a slight angle to one another or at a</span> <em class="italics">dihedral</em> <span>angle as it is called. Then if the machine tends to twist and turn over the lifting power of the lower wing becomes greater as it approaches the horizontal while that of the other wing grows less. Accordingly the machine resists and tends to turn back to its normal position.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Another method is to keep the weight or centre of gravity as low as possible so that the machine will automatically right itself as soon as it begins to turn. The objection to this, however, is that the machine will fly very unsteadily on a gusty day (and most days are more or less gusty). The effect of placing the centre of gravity low is shown in Fig. 45. The dotted line represents the centre of pressure acting against a plane P. The weight of the machine is centred at W. Imagine the machine in flight. Then the resistance of the plane P acting along the dotted line will tend to stop the machine while W tends to still go forward because of its inertia. As a result, the front of the machine tilts upwards and increases the angle of P, which in turn increases the resistance. The machine therefore slows down but W tends to still move forward and tilt the machine further until the thrust of the screw is unable to support the weight and so W swings back down and beyond the position shown at B. The angle of P decreases, the machine travels forward quickly and gathers sufficient speed for W to swing up again. Thus the performance is repeated and the machine will have a flight path very much like the dotted line shown in the lower part of the illustration. The motion is slight but is sufficient to considerably shorten the length of the flight.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>If the machine meets wind, the motion is somewhat increased. In fact the author has seen a small biplane turn completely over and actually "loop the loop." When the machine flies with the wind the effect is largely reduced. If the wind is of just the right strength and comes from the rear, the machine will fly quite steadily. If too strong, however, the model will dive to the ground. A tail somewhat dampens the swing while an elevator will slightly increase it.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The only other methods of partially mitigating the evils of a single screw are to ballast the machine, that is, place a weight on one side or to give one plane an increased sustaining surface. The first may be dismissed immediately because the weight will cause one side of the machine to drop as the elastic runs down and the reaction of the propeller becomes smaller. The last named method is the usual one employed. The wing on that side of the machine opposite to which the propeller is revolving is given a larger surface than the other and so exerts a greater lift on that side. This also has disadvantages, however, for by giving one wing a greater lifting power the machine is caused to fly in a long spiral path when the propeller begins to run down and when it stops completely to glide in the same manner.</span></p>

A machine having two propellers to the author's mind is the only one worth much attention.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Fig. 46 illustrates the simplest arrangement for fitting two propellers to a machine. In the first a second propeller is attached to the other end of the skein. At first it might seem in the second arrangement that there would be difficulty in getting the screws to revolve at the same speed. However, if the propellers are similar and the same number of rubber strands employed to drive each, the difference will be so small as to be negligible.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>When the first arrangement is employed the pitch of the screw in the rear must be slightly greater than that in the front because it is revolving in the slip of the latter.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Placing both propellers on a double shaft on the same axis has the disadvantage of decreasing the efficiency of the propellers because they are operating in each other's draft.</span></p>

      <p class="pnext"><span>The first of these methods is undoubtedly the best construction. It is then possible to use the same rubber skein to drive both propellers. Also any possible difference in their speed will not so readily cause the machine to change its course as if the propellers were alongside of each other. When two propellers are used in this latter position it is a very good idea to fit them with two small pulleys and a connecting belt so that any tendency for a difference in speed between the two will be immediately equalized.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>The power absorbed varies directly with the volume of air acted upon and the square of the speed with which it moves away. If the pitch of the propeller or its rate of revolution were doubled, four times the power previously required would be necessary. Vice versa, decreasing the rate of revolution or the pitch by one-half will make only one-fourth the power previously required necessary.</span></p>
      <p class="pnext"><span>Doubling the speed and doubling the diameter requires eight times more power. Doubling the diameter, halving the pitch and halving the speed will give twice the thrust for the same power as in the first case.</span></p>

Such single bearings are a decidedly poor and unsatisfactory construction. Unless the elastic is very short it soon begins to vibrate in unwinding. Since the rubber is directly connected to the propeller shaft, the propeller is set into vibration as shown by the dotted lines in the second part of Fig. 48. The long blades of the propeller considerably magnify the motion and there is a very appreciable loss of power due to the erratic path of the propeller and the increased friction at the bearing. The rubber skein also offers considerably more resistance to the forward travel of the machine than if it were not in vibration.</span></p>

Such an arrangement is employed on some of the French models and might be called a "friction thrust." That is, when the rubber skein is wound up tight and the propeller is released the friction acts as a brake and reduces the speed, preventing the propeller from "racing." As the elastic unwinds, the tension, and with it also, the friction becomes less so that the propeller revolves more rapidly and maintains a somewhat even speed. The importance of preserving as far as possible an even propeller speed can hardly be overestimated and that is why such emphasis has been laid in several places upon the desirability of a model whose propeller is driven by a long skein of rubber composed of the fewest possible number of strands.</span></p>

        <p class="pfirst"><span>Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.</span></p>

        <h3 class="level-3 pfirst section-title title"><span>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</span></h3>
        <p class="pfirst"><span>Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit</span> <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate">https://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

        <p class="pfirst"><span>Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Corrected</span> <em class="italics">editions</em> <span>of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.</span> <em class="italics">Versions</em> <span>based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.</span></p>
